Intent:
Useful for deleting unwanted music from the library and harddisk.  No need to
go through new music and filter the things you like.  Just delete the ugly
stuff when you encounter it the first time. :)

Install:
1. Install the following packages (names taken from Ubuntu):
     - python-xlib (python module)
     - send2trash (available from pypi)
     In Ubuntu, you can execute the following command:
     sudo apt-get install python-pip python-xlib && sudo pip install send2trash
2. Copy this directory into ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins

Structure should then look like this:

~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/
    deletefile/
        deletefile.plugin
        deletefile.py
        
3. Restart Rhythmbox
4. Go to Edit -> Plugins -> enable "Delete current song from harddisk"

Usage:
If you ever find song disgusting, hit Ctrl+'.' and it will
get deleted (moved to trash bin).
    
Configuring:
To change the hotkey, run xbindkeys -k (install xbindkeys first) and set the
relevant keysyms in deletefile.py.

    Sample:
    1. Open terminal
    1. Execute xbindkeys -k
    2. Press Ctrl+'.'
    3. xbindkeys prints:
        "NoCommand"
            m:0x14 + c:61
            Ctrl + .
    4. open ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/deletefile/deletefile.py
    5. change relevant fields to:
        # Ctrl+'.'
        delete_key = 61
        delete_mask = 0x14
    6. Save, restart rhythmbox

    Note: You could also edit deletefile.plugin to print the new hotkey in
    the description. :)

    Note: Ctrl + '.' doesn't always work with xbindkeys. If so, first get the
    keysym for the key ('.'), and then get the keysym for the modifier (Ctrl)
    in two steps
